\title{CSC300 template assignment using BibTeX to do dirty work for bibliographies}

\section{Introduction}

Bibtex \cite{original-bibtex,bibtex} is a program that works in
conjunction with latex to convert
a text database of references into a bibliography. 

This document illustrates the use of BibTeX\@.  It follows  the webpage
\cite{bibtex-tutorial}  but replaces the references of that tutorial
with a couple of the required readings for csc300, etc. 

By way of demo, You may want to refer to a journal article \cite{warren-brandeis-1890}
or a conference proceeding \cite{siva05} or a \cite{gosling-interview}
or even a book \cite {java-jvm-spec}!

\section{Thesis}

Although it has a steep, nasty learning curve, bibtex and latex are
worth considering because, at least in some academic environments, a
life sentence of reformatting citations and bibliographies is even
worse.

This demo is also available on the share latex website at \cite{shared-latex-page}

just making sure headers are working on the new page..
